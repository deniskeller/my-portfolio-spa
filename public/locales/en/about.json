  "description": "Hey! I am a web developer. I am engaged in the development of modern selling landing pages, online stores, one-page applications. As a web developer, I enjoy leveraging my obsessive attention to detail, my love of creating things, and my missionary work ethic. I always try to rely on the needs of the customer and offer my ideas for improving this or that functionality. I adhere to the deadlines, otherwise I will return part of the cost for the day of delay. I believe that the best advertising is word of mouth and therefore it is very important for me to fully satisfy the needs of the client so that there is close cooperation between us.",
