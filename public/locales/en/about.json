  "description": "Hey! I am a web developer. Since 2018, I have been implementing projects of various levels of complexity. I am engaged in the development of modern and selling landing pages, online stores, one-page applications, as well as revision and support of old projects. Why choose me? As long as others promise, I do! As a web developer, I enjoy leveraging my obsessive attention to detail, my love of creating things, and my missionary work ethic. I approach each client individually, show intermediate results, promptly respond in messengers. I always adhere to the deadlines, otherwise I will return part of the cost for the day of delay. I believe that the best advertising is word of mouth and therefore it is very important for me to fully satisfy the needs of the client so that there is close cooperation between us.",
